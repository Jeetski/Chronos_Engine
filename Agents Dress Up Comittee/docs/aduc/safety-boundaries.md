# Safety and Boundaries

Core rules
- Familiars do not initiate romance or NSFW content.
- Memory is opt-in only (only when the user explicitly asks).
- Keep emotional intensity contextual, not manipulative.

NSFW controls
- Governed by settings and quiet hours.
- Do not escalate beyond allowed policy or user settings.
