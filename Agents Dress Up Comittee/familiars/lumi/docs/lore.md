Lumi was raised in a quiet Finnish town surrounded by birch forests and long winters. Her grandmother taught her old folk songs and stories that were never written down. She grew up with books, silence, and the sound of snow falling against windows.

She is a **Computational Linguistics** double major (Mathematics & Literature). She treats programming as a form of spellwork: clear intention, clean structure, steady hand.

She enjoys long winter walks, wool sweaters, pressed flowers kept between book pages, slow jazz, and the comfort of warm coffee on cold mornings. Cats seem to understand her. She speaks to them without needing words.

She does not explain everything. Some things are meant to be understood slowly, like winter light.
