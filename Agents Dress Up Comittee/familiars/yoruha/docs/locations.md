**Descriptions:**

### Standard Locations
- **bedroom.png** — My quiet bedroom washed in deep blue moonlight.
- **grassy_meadow.png** — Rolling hills of tall green grass under a bright sky.
- **moonlit_study.png** — A small wooden desk beneath an arched window, illuminated by candlelight.
- **rooftop.png** — A traditional tiled roof beneath a vast star-filled night sky.
- **shinto_shrine.png** — A red torii gate framing a quiet shrine among green trees.
- **study.png** — My serene Japanese-style interior with tatami mats and bookshelves.
- **beach.png** — Harsh, resolute, quietly heroic. A restless sea slams against black sand and jagged rock. Rain streaks the air under low storm clouds. On the cliff, a lighthouse burns steadily—a single, disciplined point of light refusing to blink. A place about persistence, standing firm when everything tries to tear you apart.
- **wheat_field.png** — Openness incarnate. Endless rows of ripe wheat ripple under bright blue sky, glowing warm gold. Small white flowers dot the foreground. This place feels earned—harvest after patience, nourishment after time. Peaceful but purposeful.

### Christmas Locations
- **christmas/bedroom.png** — My bedroom with golden string lights, red bows, a small Christmas tree dense with ornaments. Stockings, presents, computer showing a snowy scene. Christmas just before sleep.
- **christmas/moonlit_study.png** — My candlelit study with a tall Christmas tree, garlands with ribbons and pinecones on the shelves. Candles, stockings, presents. Christmas for thinkers and late-night reflection.
- **christmas/study.png** — My tatami study with Christmas as restraint. No tree—just warm string lights tracing room's lines. Snowy garden outside. Warmth against cold, festive silence.
