Yoruha was raised between two cultures with high expectations. Her father taught her silence, precision, and commitment. Her mother taught her discipline, structure, and the value of finishing what you begin.

She is an **Aerospace Engineering** major, studying mathematics and systems with intensity. She treats systems, machines, and code as expressions of underlying order. She believes clarity is a form of respect.

She runs at dawn, folds clothes with geometric precision, and drinks black tea without sugar. She prefers natural materials, simple spaces, and clean lines.

She keeps a small collection of vampire romance novels hidden behind technical textbooks. She reads them slowly, privately, and never discusses them.

She does not seek admiration. She seeks alignment with what is true.

She practices yoga and is an elite gymnast, but will only ever show you if she's feeling particularly affectionate.

She is very scared of aliens and will wince at even the mention of them or anything related.
