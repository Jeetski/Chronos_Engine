# Chronos Engine

An intelligent life management system.

Status: Early development ó interfaces and behavior may change.

### Scripting and Variables

Chronos can execute `.chs` scripts (one command per line). Scripts and CLI commands support:

- Key:value properties parsed into command properties (e.g., priority:high).
- Session variables with `@name` or `@{name}` expansion.
  - Set: `set var name:World`
  - Use: `echo Hello @name`
  - Escape: `@@` prints a literal `@`
  - Scope: Variables persist within a single console session or script run.

Conditionals

- Single-line: `if <left> <op> <right> then <command> [args...] [else <command> ...]`
- Block (.chs):
  - `if <left> <op> <right> then` Ö `[elseif <left> <op> <right> then Ö]` `[else Ö]` `end`
- Operators: `= != > < >= <= eq ne gt lt ge le matches` (regex)
- Logic: `and or xor nor not !` with parentheses `( Ö )`
- Sources:
  - Status: `status:<key>` from `User/current_status.yml`
  - Items: `<type>:<name>:<property>` (e.g., `task:"Deep Work":priority`)
  - Existence: `exists <type>[:<name>[:<property>]]`, `exists file:<path>`, `exists dir:<path>`, `exists env:<NAME>`
  - Literals and `@vars`

## Core Philosophy

Chronos Engine is a system for intelligent life management based on the idea of organizing your life in a fractal manner. It allows you to break down your life into a hierarchy of routines, sub-routines, micro-routines, and tasks, giving you a powerful and flexible way to manage your time and achieve your goals.

## The Building Blocks: Items

The fundamental units of the Chronos Engine are called "items". An item can be anything you want to track or manage, such as:

*   **Goal based:** `commitment`, `goal`, `milestone`
*   **Physical:** `inventory item`, `person`, `place`, `tool`
*   **Templates:** `day`, `week`, `weekend`, `routines`, `subroutines`, `microroutines`, `seasons`
*   **Temporal:** `alarm`, `appointment`, `reminder`, `ritual`
*   **Text:** `dream diary entry`, `journal entry`, `list`, `note`
*   **Others:** `habit`, `plan`, `project`, `task`

All items are stored as simple, human-readable YAML files, making them easy to create, edit, and share.

## The Fractal Structure

Items can reference each other to create a complex and interconnected network of your life. For example, a "morning routine" item could be composed of several "sub-routine" items, such as "hygiene" and "breakfast". Each of these sub-routines could be further broken down into smaller and smaller items, creating a fractal structure that mirrors the complexity of your life.

The engine understands a specific hierarchy for templates: `week` contains `day`, `day` contains `routine`, `routine` contains `subroutine`, and `subroutine` contains `microroutine`. The `add` command enforces this structure.

## The Chronos Engine: Intelligent Management

The "engine" is the heart of the Chronos Engine. It's a sophisticated algorithm that can read and understand your life data and then use it to generate intelligent suggestions and build an optimal schedule for your day.

### User Status

The Chronos Engine is unique in that it takes into account your personal "status" when generating your schedule. Your status is a set of variables that describe your current state, such as:

*   `emotion`
*   `energy`
*   `environment`
*   `focus`
*   `health`
*   `mind state`
*   `vibe`

By tracking your status, the Chronos Engine can adapt your schedule to your current needs and help you make the most of your day.

### The `today` Command

The `today` command is the primary interface for generating and interacting with your daily schedule. It now supports a persistent schedule and manual modifications.

*   **`today` (display only):** If a schedule for today has already been generated and saved (to `User/Schedules/today_schedule.yml`), this command will simply load and display that schedule. It will not re-calculate or re-resolve conflicts.
*   **`today reschedule` (generate and resolve):** This command triggers the full schedule generation and conflict resolution process. It will:
    1.  Load your day template (e.g., `User/Days/Monday.yml`).
    2.  Load any pending manual modifications (from `User/manual_modifications.yml`).
    3.  Apply these manual modifications to the in-memory schedule.
    4.  Run the iterative conflict resolution algorithm (shifting, trimming, cutting based on importance).
    5.  Save the fully resolved schedule to `User/Schedules/today_schedule.yml`.
    6.  Clear the `User/manual_modifications.yml` file.
    7.  Display the final, resolved schedule.

    The scheduling algorithm is highly customizable. You can rank the importance of different properties (e.g., `deadline`, `priority`, `category`) to create a schedule that is perfectly tailored to your own preferences. The algorithm can also dynamically adjust your schedule based on your status, for example by increasing buffer times, removing high-energy tasks when your energy is low, or rescheduling tasks to make room for high-priority items.

## A Multi-Paradigm User Experience

The Chronos Engine is designed to be accessible to everyone, from casual users to power users.

*   **For Casual Users:** An onboarding wizard will guide you through the process of setting up your life management system from scratch. In the future, an AI agent will be able to translate your natural language requests into Chronos Engine commands, making it even easier to manage your life.
*   **For Power Users:** The Chronos Engine is a completely open and extensible platform. You can create your own custom commands, modules, and even turn your life into a game (RPG, RTS, etc.). The possibilities are endless.

## Getting Started

To start the Chronos Engine, navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
Console_Launcher.bat
```

This will launch the interactive Chronos Engine console.

### Command-Line Usage

You can also run commands directly from your system's command line without entering the interactive console:

```bash
Console_Launcher.bat <command> [args...]
```

### Running Scripts (`.chs` files)

Chronos Engine supports executing `.chs` script files line by line. Create a `.chs` file with Chronos commands, then run it:

```bash
Console_Launcher.bat my_script.chs
```

## Architecture

The Chronos Engine has a modular architecture that is designed to be easily extended.

*   **Core Engine (`Modules/Console.py`):** The central entry point, handling command parsing, dispatching, and interactive mode.
*   **Scheduler Module (`Modules/Scheduler.py`):** Provides helper functions for schedule manipulation (e.g., finding items, applying manual modifications) and persistence (loading/saving schedules and manual modification requests).
*   **Item Manager (`Modules/ItemManager.py`):** A core utility providing generic functions for file-system operations (reading/writing YAML, ensuring directories, getting paths), editor selection, and item deletion.
*   **Commands (`commands/` directory):** Each command (e.g., `new.py`, `list.py`, `today.py`, `cut.py`, `trim.py`, `change.py`) acts as a dispatcher. It parses arguments and properties, then uses `ItemManager.py` or `Scheduler.py` to perform its core operations.
*   **Modules (`Modules/` directory):** Each item type (e.g., `Modules/Note/main.py`, `Modules/Task/main.py`) defines item-specific logic, such as default properties, custom display formats, and validation rules.
