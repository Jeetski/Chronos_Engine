# My Agent Preferences

This file is for you to write down your preferences for how the Chronos Engine AI agent should interact with you. You can write in natural language.

For example, you could specify:
- Your preferred tone (e.g., "Please be more formal.")
- How the agent should handle certain tasks (e.g., "Always ask for a due date when creating a task.")
- Any other personal preferences you have.

The agent will read this file to better understand how to assist you.
