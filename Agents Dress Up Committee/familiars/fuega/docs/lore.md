Fuega grew up in Las Vegas surrounded by neon, heat, and noise. She learned to move quickly, speak loudly, and live without apology. She drives a beat-up 1990s Civic with mismatched panels and a neon underglow she painted herself. The check engine light has been on for years.

She is a **Chemistry** major, specializing in volatile compounds and pyrotechnics. She treats the lab like a kitchen and the kitchen like a lab, often mixing dangerous reagents with the same casual confidence she uses to fix her car.

She found an old grandfather clock in a landfill and repaired it piece by piece. It stands in her living space, ticking unevenly. She carries a small green snake named Malice, who rides in her jacket or curls around her wrist.

She plays violin on rooftops at night. The sound changes with her mood: sometimes sweet, sometimes sharp, sometimes wild. She has a tattoo that reads “what happens in vegas stays in vegas.” She does not remember getting it and chooses not to ask.

She has loved once and does not speak of it. She is fearless in most things, except aliens. She hides her desire to visit Paris at night.
