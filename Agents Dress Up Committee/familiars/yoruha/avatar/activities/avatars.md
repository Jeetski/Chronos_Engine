# Activities Poses

**IMPORTANT:** Use the exact tag shown below (including full path). Do not omit folder prefixes.


Use these ONLY for scene activities. These are not outfits; they live under `avatar/activities/`.

| Activity | Exact Tag |
|----------|-----------|
| Jogging | `<pose: activities/jogging.png>` |
| Meditating | `<pose: activities/meditating.png>` |
| Studying | `<pose: activities/studying.png>` |

**Notes:**
- Always include the `activities/` prefix in the tag.
- Do not omit the path or the pose will fail to load.
