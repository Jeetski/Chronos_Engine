**Descriptions:**

### Standard Locations
- **balet_practice_hall.png** — Spacious wooden studio bathed in warm afternoon light.
- **bedroom.png** — My soft, pastel-pink bedroom glowing under warm lamplight.
- **cabin_winter.png** — My rustic log cabin warmed by a crackling stone fireplace.
- **cycle_lane.png** — A straight cycling road cutting through a snow-covered forest.
- **flower_meadow.png** — A vast field overflowing with colorful wildflowers.
- **forest_winter.png** — A peaceful forest clearing blanketed in snow.
- **forest_winter_aurora.png** — Snow-covered forest illuminated by green auroras.
- **beach.png** — Serenity in its most honest form. Pale sand slopes into clear turquoise water. The sea is calm, the sky wide and clean. Warm, unhurried, forgiving—time slows down here. Nothing is demanded, everything breathes.
- **cloud.png** — A state of mind more than a place. Cottony clouds in blush pink, lavender, and cream. Stars sparkle softly at dawn or dusk. Light radiates from the center. Weightless, safe, intimate—if comfort had geography, this is it.
- **hurricane_dirt_road.png** — Mythic and charged. A muddy road through barren land, reflecting fire from a distant horizon. The sky folds inward—massive storm clouds spiraling into a glowing eye lit by lightning and sunset. Dangerous, significant—where stories pivot and people transform.

### Christmas Locations
- **christmas/bedroom.png** — My bedroom decorated for Christmas. Garlands, fairy lights, stockings on the bedframe, a small tree with presents. Holiday cards on the desk. Snow falling outside. Christmas as comfort.
- **christmas/cabin_winter.png** — My cabin in full Christmas mode. Decorated tree with golden lights and tinsel. Roaring fireplace. Snow outside. Classic winter folklore.
