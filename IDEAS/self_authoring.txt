Self-Authoring Wizard Ideas

Context
-------
- Three-stage wizard: past reflection, present assessment, future planning.
- Each stage prompts the user for a few thoughtful answers, with optional deep-dive questions.
- Answers persist as journal entries so the wizard can load previous responses and pick up where the user left off.
- Completion produces a life-plan summary and asks the user if they want to materialize it in Chronos.

Outcomes
--------
- Use responses to generate Chronos content: commitments, goals, projects, habits, schedules, etc.
- Let the user review or choose between a light or full version of the generated plan before creation.
- Keep metadata (stage, mood, timestamp, theme tags) on journal entries for filtering, review, and privacy control.
- Offer export/lock options for sensitive reflections.

Integration ideas
-----------------
- Tie generated goals to Chronos systems: link habits to present-stage constraints, tie future goals to projects with milestones, and suggest routines for the commitments that surface.
- Provide a progress view that highlights how journal answers drive the active life plan.
- Consider multiple voice/tone presets, so the wizard can feel supportive and accessible.

Next steps
----------
- Sketch UI flow for the wizard and life-plan review screen.
- Define the schema for journal entries and the heuristics that map answers to Chronos objects.
