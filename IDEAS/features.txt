Chronos Feature Ideas

1. Narrative Timeline View
- Dashboard layer that frames goals, projects, milestones, and commitments as “chapters” in a life story.
- Visual timeline + cards that show how current tasks/habits feed into future chapters.
- Allow collapsing/expanding phases and linking commitments to a larger story arc.

2. Triggered Schedule Injections
- Monitor user signals (low focus, fatigue, calendar gaps) to insert gentle nudges like meditation, movement, breathing breaks, or checklists.
- Configurable triggers linked to statuses and manual override (accept/snooze/change).
- Track impact to fine-tune what gets injected and when.

3. Random Item Picker Widget
- Panel/widget that pulls a random task, habit, or commitment, optionally filtered by category, priority, energy, or project.
- Supports “re-roll,” “lock,” and maybe “discover a new focus” modes with contextual prompts.
- Great for getting unstuck or remixing the day when too many choices feel draining.

4. Theme Calendars
- Let users define yearly/monthly/weekly/day-of-week themes with nicknames (e.g., “Year of the Dragon,” “Sober October,” “Grind Week,” “Mystic Monday”) that influence the tone or labels of their schedule and reminders.
- Themes can suggest default commitments/habits or wiring to highlight certain tasks when that timeframe is active.
- Allow chaining themes so users can declare a “Month of X” within a “Year of Y” and surface overlays in dashboards.

5. Flashcard Panel
- Widget that cycles through YAML-backed cards and displays the key/value pairs on screen.
- Filters allow users to scope to certain items, tags, or priorities before flipping through.
- Serves as a quick rehearsal surface for commitments, journal takeaways, or goals without leaving Chronos.

6. New Year’s Resolution Wizard
- Guided flow for clarifying the current year’s priorities, linking them to goals, habits, and commitments, and sealing them as a “resolution plan.”
- Pulls from last year’s reflections and lets users break big resolutions into manageable weekly/monthly actions.
- Offers ceremonial touches (e.g., affirmation, progress check-ins) and exports entries to journals so the dashboard can highlight them throughout the year.

7. Installer Experience
- Provide a polished MSI/EXE installer that sets up Chronos, runs dependency checks, and walks users through the configuration via a wizard.
- Handles workspace initialization, optional feature packs selection, and creates shortcuts or services so Chronos is ready immediately after install.

8. Cockpit Bays
- Allow multiple named cockpit “views” (bays) so users can switch between different dashboard layouts quickly.
- Each bay can expose a unique combination of widgets, timelines, focus tools, and themed highlights for different contexts (creative work, planning, recovery, etc.).
- Provide easy controls for duplicating, renaming, rearranging, or sharing bays.

9. Triggered Automations
- “If (not) X (or Y) (and Z) (but not A), do Y” rule builder that responds to schedule/context signals with injections, reminders, or habit tweaks.
- Use sequence commands or review workflows that compare trends (from SQLite/algos) to identify unscheduled commitments and output `suggestions.md` with actionable prompts.
- Hook into invitation logic so automation suggestions can nudge the user to attach templates, deadlines, or habits to otherwise unassigned items.

10. Story-Driven Analytics
- Narrative-style recaps built from Chronos data (SQLite + sequence algorithms) that explain what worked, what shifted, and why each insight matters.
- Sequence workflows can churn trends into contextual stories, highlight themes from bays, and connect reflections to future priorities.

11. Character RPG Panel
- RPG-style character panel with stats, armor, weapons, magic, and upgrade paths tied to commitments, habits, or streaks.
- Passively buff your avatar by completing logged achievements and spend points to customize gear, unlock abilities, or trigger cosmetic effects.
- Future collaborative mode could turn this into a shared MMO-like experience (raid bosses, PvP, co-op story missions) using the planned collaboration features so friends can quest together.

12. Flexible List Galleries
- Treat lists as todo-style commands but also as visual galleries for checklists, reading lists, wishlists, or any other curated collection.
- Provide configurable card/row layouts, progress indicators, and quick add/complete actions so these lists feel tactile and expressive.
- Allow pinning lists to bays or widgets, linking them to journals, and sharing them with collaborators for collective inspiration.

13. Status Refresh Prompts
- Detect when a user’s status hasn’t been updated for a long time (e.g., after running `today reschedule`) and treat it as stagnant.
- Auto-reprompt the user to clarify their current status, optionally suggesting updates or letting them refresh focus blocks.
- Use this signal to keep dashboards and automations aligned with what’s actually happening, rather than stale states.

14. Embedded Audio Widget
- Lightweight MP3 player widget that lets users queue focus playlists (binaural beats, lofi, etc.) directly inside Chronos.
- Supports custom uploads or linking to hosted tracks so creators can promote their own music or curated mixes.
- Includes basic playback controls, volume, looping, and optional syncing with focus sessions or rituals.

15. Timeline View
- A new dashboard view that renders tasks/projects with concrete due dates on a horizontal timeline so you can see what's coming up at a glance.
- Pull scheduled/due data from existing items and show colored markers/blocks; zoom controls (day/week/month) keep the lane readable.
- Clicking a marker should open the underlying item or let you jump straight into rescheduling/editing without leaving the view.

16. Terminal Autosuggest Dropdown
- Enhance the dashboard Terminal widget with a dropdown autosuggest (commands + recent history + known item types). 
- Should appear on typing with keyboard navigation; accept/insert suggestions without losing current input. 
- Suggestions: Chronos commands, wizard names, dashboard shortcuts, and a few last typed lines (persisted).
- Must respect existing keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+L clear, Enter submit) and stay lightweight/offline.
