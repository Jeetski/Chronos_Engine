Chronos Extensibility Ideas

1. Rich scripting layer
- Expose Chronos data (journal entries, commitments, schedules, themes) to sandboxed scripts so developers can build games, visualizers, or bespoke automations that feel native.
- Include helper APIs for creating widgets/panels, posting notifications, or inserting generated content into bays.
- Ship a CLI/browser REPL for experimenting with Chronos objects in real-time and iterating on scripts quickly.

2. Clean API surface
- Provide documented REST/WS endpoints and SDKs so external tools can read/write data, subscribe to change events, and trigger automations.
- Offer authentication flows (tokens, OAuth) and rate-limiting to keep the ecosystem stable while empowering integrations.
- Surface a script/plugin registry so users can discover, enable, or disable community contributions safely.

3. Plugin hosting UX
- Allow plugins or scripts to register UI hooks (dashboard cards, timeline overlays, inbox widgets) and be managed like optional feature packs.
- Sandbox execution and resource caps keep custom scripts reliable while still powerful.
- Provide example repos or templates (games, visualizers, automation recipes) to inspire community creativity.
