Tasks

- Estimates: Planned vs actual minutes; auto-trim or slip rules.
- States: start/pause/finish; auto-bump priority if overdue.
- Dependencies: soft/hard predecessors; block scheduling until
ready.
- Effort profile: energy/focus requirements to drive
status-aware ranking.
- Work windows: preferred times (“creative mornings”, “admin
afternoons”).

Habits

- Streak engine: grace days, streak‑freeze, skip vs fail
semantics.
- Targets: per-day counts (e.g., 3× hydrate) and weekly quotas.
- Ramp rules: progressive overload (e.g., +5m/week), deload
weeks.
- Miss recovery: “bounce back” logic that tapers duration/
priority post-failure.
- Habit stacking: attach habit to routine anchors for sticky
scheduling.

Routines/Subroutines/Microroutines

- Variants: “weekday”, “travel”, “low‑energy” profiles
auto-selected by status.
- Parallel semantics: explicit lanes (e.g., audio + chore) with
cap limits.
- Buffer policy: embed micro-buffers between microroutines,
global buffers between blocks.
- Rollup: parent duration = explicit vs span-of-children with
safeguards.

Projects

- Rollups: aggregate progress from tasks; burn‑down/burn‑up
metrics.
- Scopes: milestones, risk flags, critical path awareness for
scheduling.
- Modes: deep-work intensity suggestion based on project type.

Goals/Milestones

- Alignment: goals influence priority score (OKRs/areas).
- Deadline pressure: non-linear importance curve as due date
approaches.
- Review cadence: prompt weekly/monthly goal reviews via today
reschedule.

Appointments

- Timezones: auto-shift for travel; daylight saving safe.
- Travel time: pre/post buffers based on Place distance.
- Prep/follow‑up: auto-insert prep tasks and debrief notes.

Reminders/Alarms

- Snooze strategies: fixed, exponential, or contextual (avoid
meetings).
- Smart mute: auto-silence in deep work or appointments.
- Scripts: before/after hooks (run a .chs when firing/
dismissed).

Notes/Journal Entries

- Meeting notes: link to appointment; auto-suggest action items
as tasks.
- Templates: standups, week reviews, project logs with rollup
extraction.
- Sentiment/tagging: feed status or priority signals.

Plans/Lists

- Checklists: weighted items and completion scoring.
- Packing kits: combine Places + Tools with occasion-based
variants.

People/Places

- Context costs: switching cost penalties by Place/Environment.
- Social commitments: follow-ups after meetings; last-contact
recency nudges.

Tools/Inventory

- Availability windows: block tasks when tool not available.
- Maintenance: recurring tasks for calibration/refills.

Days/Weeks

- Day energy profile: morning/evening chronotypes adjust item
rankings.
- Thematic days: “Admin Tuesday,” “Maker Wednesday” guiding
default priorities.

Engine Hooks (cross-cutting)

- Importance model: per-type weighting and property‑based boosts
(deadline, impact, status match).
- Conflict policy: per-type strategies (trim task before cutting
habit; never trim appointments).
- Dynamic duration: tasks shorten when low energy; routines
expand with buffers when stressed.
- Parallel caps: type‑based max concurrent items (e.g., 1
cognitive + 1 passive).
- Completion semantics: single‑shot vs repeating vs streaked.

Command Extensions (examples)

- task: start/stop, estimate , log , split, defer .
- habit: skip today, reset streak, set target_count:.
- routine: use variant , activate/deactivate, promote to day.
- project: rollup, risk:set <low/med/high>, focus-window
HH:MM-HH:MM (HH:MM-HH:MM).
- appointment: add travel from , prep:, followup:.

Data Model Enhancements

- Common: effort:{energy,focus}, impact, deadline, window,
buffers, depends_on.
- Habit: target_count, grace_days, streak_policy, ramp.
- Appointment: timezone, place, travel_time_rule.
- Routine: variant, parallel_lanes, buffer_policy.
