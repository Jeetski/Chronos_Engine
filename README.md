# Chronos Engine

YAML-first life management engine with a scriptable CLI, background listener (alarms, reminders, timer), and a lightweight dashboard.

Quickstart
- Onboarding: run `onboarding_wizard.bat` for a guided CLI setup, or open the dashboard and launch **Chronos Onboarding Wizard** from the Wizards menu.
- Install: run `install_dependencies.bat` (creates `.venv`, installs deps)
- CLI: `console_launcher.bat` then `help`
- Listener: `listener_launcher.bat`
- Dashboard: run `dashboard_launcher.bat`, or in the Console run `dashboard` (alias `dash`)
- Platform: developed and tested primarily on Windows 10/11; Linux/macOS support via the `.sh` launch scripts is currently experimental.
